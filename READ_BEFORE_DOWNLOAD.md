¦¦¦ READ THIS BEFORE DOWNLOADING!!! ¦¦¦

This game have a script to turn off your pc if you die, there is no malware inside of the script (if you are not sure, just open the .py file with an IDE or notepad)

My tip to you, player: Be careful with your choices, if you die in the game, your PC will "die" too

(don't worry, the pc will only turn off)
